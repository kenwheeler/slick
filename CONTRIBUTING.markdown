## Submitting issues

### Test case required

All bug reports and problem issues require a jsFiddle. You can create one at [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net).

+ A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case, your issue may be closed.

You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided demo.

## Support

If you are having problems getting Slick to work, or can't figure something out, this repository's issues section is not the place to ask about it.

I have set up a subreddit for Slick discussion at [reddit.com/r/slickcarousel](http://www.reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/).

Please use this as an area to discuss Slick and any issues you may have.

## Feature Requests

If you would like to request or propose a feature, please do so in the the Slick subreddit - [reddit.com/r/slickcarousel](http://www.reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/). 

## Pull requests

Contributions are welcome! That said, please be prepared to edit your pull request at request, and provide a jsFiddle of your fork working interoperably with every "mode" that Slick supports, and with varying numbers of slides, slidesToShow & slidesToScroll. Failure to do so will result in your pull request being closed.

Please note that while Slick is open source, this is still my baby, and by submitting a pull request you are authorizing me to edit or modify it in any way shape or form. You will be listed in Github as a contributor, but I have and will continue to steer the direction of this project.
